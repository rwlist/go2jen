# go2jen

Convert Go code to [dave/jen](https://github.com/dave/jennifer) codegeneration, right in the browser.

This project is based on [aloder/tojen](https://github.com/aloder/tojen), which converts go to jennifer declarations.
Before I used to know about this project, I wanted to implement this myself, but was fortunate enough to discover it in
short time.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement Yandex.Cloud function for code conversion
- [ ] Deploy this in YCloud
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Implement simple frontend with convert button
- [ ] Deploy frontend on GitHub / somewhere else
- [ ] Test everything
